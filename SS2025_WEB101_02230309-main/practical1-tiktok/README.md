# Practical 1 Reflection: TikTok Clone ðŸŽ¥

## ðŸ”§ What I Built

A mini TikTok-style web app using **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It includes:
- A scrollable video feed
- Sidebar navigation (For You, Following, Explore, Live, Profile)
- Login and signup forms
- A mock upload page
- Fully responsive layout (mobile-first)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

### Next.js App Router  
Built pages using the new App Router structure â€” it made routing clean and easy to manage.

### Component Reusability  
Used React to split the UI into reusable components like `VideoCard`, `VideoFeed`, and `MainLayout`. This made updates and maintenance simple.

### Form Validation  
Used **React Hook Form** for:
- Email/password checks
- Confirm password logic
- Error handling for clean UX

### Tailwind Styling  
Styled everything with Tailwind CSS:
- Fast, responsive layout
- Dark mode ready
- Clean utility-first design

### Project Structure  
Organized files in `src/`, using folders like `/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, and specific routes like `/profile`, `/login`, etc.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Smooth navigation between pages  
- Simple scrollable video cards  
- Form validation with clear errors  
- Mobile-ready design with clean layout

## ðŸ§ª How I Tested It

- Tried submitting empty/invalid forms  
- Checked all nav links and routes  
- Resized browser for mobile behavior  

## ðŸ’­ What Could Be Improved

In the future, Iâ€™d like to:
- Add real backend support  
- Store videos in a DB  
- Implement real-time features (like comments or live video)  
- Add proper authentication and media upload

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Thoughts

This was a fun and practical way to apply modern frontend skills. I gained hands-on experience with Next.js, Tailwind, and form handling â€” and saw how everything comes together to build an interactive, responsive web app.

**Biggest takeaway**: Simplicity, structure, and reusable components are key to scalable frontend development.
